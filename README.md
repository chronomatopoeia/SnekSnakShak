# SnekSnakShak
game for Low Stakes High Rolling 3 Jam on Itch

Ever had one of those days when even the cafeteria is horror? Welcome to the dungeon cafeteria, snek snak shak.

The workplace cafeteria is a small but brutal world. Snek has to work during vacation and is nearly alone except for a thieving ghost, but at some point his other monster dungeon inmates will return (in development). Help him scrape together enough for a ratburger or a slaughtered pig sandwich.

Use WASD for movement and surprise reverse movement feature.

Use space bar for spinning if you wish.
